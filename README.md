## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**crobbs05/crobbs05** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
In my past life I was an urban planning and GIS professional. Switched gears and my new focus is analytics and data viz. 

My analytics toolbox is the R ecosystem and ggplot for data visualization. I use other tools, but R is my favorite.

I am aiming to add D3 to my tool belt in the near future.

Most, if not all, of my personal projects will focus on the social phenomena of the built environment, which is one aspect of my previous career that is bonded to my soul.
